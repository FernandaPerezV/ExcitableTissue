# ExcitableTissue
These Pythons codes simulate an excitable ordered tissue.

The Mathematica file EffectiveModel.nb shows the numerical analysis done for the one-dimensional effective model.

The Python file MainFile.py runs the simulation of an ordered tissue with a single junction activated manually at t=0. Data is saved in "length_tensions" and "results" folders.
The Python file snapshots.py generate the tissue figure, at each saved time, with each junction colored by state: inactive (gray), active (red), refractory (blue).
